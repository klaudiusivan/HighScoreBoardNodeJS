# Game Leaderboard Project

## Overview

This project aims to create a leaderboard system for online games using Node.js and MongoDB. The leaderboard will allow players to track their scores and rankings in various games.

## Features

- **Player Registration:** Players can register with their name, email, and date of birth.
- **Score Submission:** Players can submit their scores for different games.
- **Leaderboard Display:** The leaderboard will display top players' scores and rankings for each game.
- **RESTful API:** Provides endpoints for CRUD operations on player data and game scores.
- **Authentication:** Secure endpoints using JSON Web Tokens (JWT) to authenticate players.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js:** JavaScript runtime for server-side development.
- **Express.js:** Web framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **MongoDB:** NoSQL database for storing player data and game scores.
- **Mongoose:** Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB.
- **JSON Web Tokens (JWT):** For authenticating and authorizing API requests.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/game-leaderboard.git
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    cd game-leaderboard
    npm install
    ```

3. Set up environment variables:

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

    ```
    PORT=3000
    MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/game-leaderboard
    JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key
    ```

4. Start the server:

    ```bash
    npm start
    ```

## Usage

- **Player Registration:** Send a POST request to `/api/players/register` with player details in the request body.
- **Score Submission:** Send a POST request to `/api/scores/submit` with the player's ID and score data in the request body.
- **Leaderboard Display:** Access the leaderboard at `/api/leaderboard`.

## Roadmap

- Implement authentication and authorization using JWT.
- Improve error handling and validation for API endpoints.
- Add pagination to leaderboard for better performance.
- Implement caching to optimize leaderboard queries.
